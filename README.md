# CSCI-5922-Deep-Learning-Project


* This is the repo for my CSCI 5922: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project. 
* The project aims to introduce the audience to the realm of image super resolution.
* The model is developed using autoencoders to predict the high resolution image from the given low resolution image.
* The model can be tested on this website: https://light-processor-403701.ue.r.appspot.com/
